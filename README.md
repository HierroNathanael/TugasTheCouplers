# The Couplers Code Smell

This repository is dedicated to explaining "The Couplers" code smell, a common issue in software development where classes are overly dependent on each other, leading to rigid and difficult-to-maintain code.

## Overview

The Couplers code smell occurs when one class is overly dependent on another class or multiple other classes. This can result in a variety of problems, including:

- **Feature Envy:** When a class uses methods or properties of another class excessively.
- **Inappropriate Intimacy:** When classes are too tightly coupled, knowing too much about each other's implementation details.
- **Message Chain:** When a client sends a series of messages to navigate through objects to get the desired information.
- **Middle Man:** When a class delegates too much to another class, acting as a middle man without adding much value.
- **Incomplete Library Class:** When a library class lacks necessary functionality, leading to clients adding code to complete its functionality.
